👋 Hi, I’m Betül.

🌍 I have a passion for languages and love connecting with people. I can hold conversations in Japanese, German, English, and my native Turkish.

🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++ at 42 Turkey.

💻 I haven’t decided on a specific path in programming yet, but I’m exploring various fields to find where I can make a meaningful impact and truly enjoy my work.
